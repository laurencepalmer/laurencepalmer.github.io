Thanks for coming to my site!  I'm a master's student at UC Berkeley studying Industrial Engineering and Ops Research.  I did my undergrad at UC Santa Barbara doubling in Applied Math and Economics.  In Fall 2023, I'm planning on attending USC for an MS in Computer Science.  

I love sports so some of my posts might be about football or baseball.  Also, I enjoy anything outdoors including skiing, golfing, or surfing.
