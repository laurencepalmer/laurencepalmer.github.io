<h1>About Me</h1>
Thanks for coming to my site!  I'm a master's student at UC Berkeley studying Industrial Engineering and Ops Research.  I did my undergrad at UC Santa Barbara doubling in Applied Math and Economics.  In Fall 2023, I'm planning on attending USC for an MS in Computer Science.  

 I enjoy anything outdoors including skiing, golfing, or surfing.  I've also been playing a lot of chess recently but can't seem to get over the 900-1000 hump in rapid.  If you're reading this and you're good at chess, email me a book recommendation and your [chess.com](https://www.chess.com/home) username.  Thanks for reading!
