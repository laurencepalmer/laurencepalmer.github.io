<h1>About Me</h1>

I'm an MS student in the computer science department at the University of Southern California. Previously, I was 
at UC Berkeley (M.Eng Industrial Engineering and Ops Research) and UC Santa Barbara (B.S. Applied Math, B.A. Economics). I've worked 
at a few places in between academic stops including [Veryfi](https://www.veryfi.com), [Shelton AI](https://www.sheltonai.com/), and [Emendata](https://www.emendatallc.com/). The Shelton AI [capstone project](https://medium.com/berkeley-fung-institute/combining-superlative-ai-research-with-berkeleys-next-unicorn-ecaa1ee958a1) was concurrent with my time at Berkeley. 

Currently, I work in the [Media Communications Laboratory (MCL)](https://mcl.usc.edu/people/) as a GSR under the supervision of Prof. C.C. Jay Kuo. I focus on computer vision algorithms within the [green learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00965) framework. Some of my research interests are: 

- Image Restoration (Denoising, Dehazing, etc.)
- Blind Image/Video Quality Assessments
- Knowledge Graphs
