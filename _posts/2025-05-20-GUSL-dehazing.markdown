Happy to announce that our paper "GUSL-Dehaze: A Green U-Shaped Learning Approach to Image Dehazing" with Mahtab Movaheddrad and Professor C.-C. Jay Kuo has been accepted to MIPR 2025! This is my first publication, and I'm elated to have been part of this project. 

In this paper, we introduce a novel dehazing method that forgoes deep learning techniques and is entirely feed-forward. We achieved performance on par with deep learning models that require far greater storage and compute capacity, which is not guaranteed, particularly on edge devices. Here's a recent <a href="/assets/pdf/Dehazing_sub.pdf">draft<a>.
