Thanks for coming to my site!  I'm a master's student at UC Berkeley studying Industrial Engineering and Ops Research.  I did my undergrad at UC Santa Barbara doubling in 
applied math and economics.  I love sports so a lot of my posts might be about football or baseball.  

I enjoy anything outdoors including skiing, golfing, or surfing.
